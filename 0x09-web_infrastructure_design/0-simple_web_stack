# Based on the search results, it appears that when a user requests a website, their computer is communicating with the web server using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
# Based on the search results, the server uses the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website 
# A single point of failure (SPOF) is a potential risk posed by a flaw in the design, implementation or configuration of a circuit or system.
# SPOF refers to one fault or malfunction that can cause an entire system to stop operating.
# Downtime is much more critical to an organization because it means a single point of failure was ignored or overlooked or failover systems 
#weren’t able to seamlessly take over.One of the search results (result 4) mentions that a limitation of a system is that it 
"Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic."
